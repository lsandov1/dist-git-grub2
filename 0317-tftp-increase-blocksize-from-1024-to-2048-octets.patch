Subject: [PATCH] tftp: increase blocksize from 1024 to 1428 octets

The RFC2348 [0] defines how the TFTP Blocksize Option should be negotiated
between the client and the server. GRUB just hardcodes this to 1024, which
limits the maximum file size to be downloaded to 67107840 byes, since the
block number is stored in a 16-bit field.

This limit is a problem when attempting to fetch large files (i.e: initrd
images) because the block number will overflow, and GRUB will never ack a
packet. This causes a timeout when trying to download the file over TFTP.

Since the TFTP support in GRUB is used primarily to fetch the kernel and
initrd images, let's bump the blocksize to 1428 which would allow to get
larger files.

The value of 1428 is chosen to increase the maximum file size limit, while
avoiding IP packet fragmentation which could be a problem in some networks.

The TFTP support should be improved to define the blocksize dynamically
instead of hardcoding it, but until that happens is better to use a value
that at least allows to fetch kernel and initrd images with the sizes that
are present in the install media that is used for network booting.
