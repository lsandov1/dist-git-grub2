Subject: [PATCH] Fix const char ** pointers in grub-core/net/url.c

This will need to get folded back in the right place on the next rebase,
but it's before "Make grub_strtol() "end" pointers have safer const
qualifiers" currently, so for now I'm leaving it here instead of merging
it back with the original patch.
